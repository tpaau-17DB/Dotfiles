# Dotfiles

**My desktop dotfiles, feel free to use in your own rices!**


## My Setup

* OS: Arch Linux
* Shell: Fish
* Terminal: Kitty
* DE: Hyprland
* Bar: Waybar
* Font: Hack Nerd Font
* Launcher: Wofi
* Lock: Swaylock
* Session Management: Wlogout
* Notifications: Mako
* Text Editior: Neovim


## Installing

First you need to clone the repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/tpaau-17DB/Dotfiles.git
```

Then you can start copying the dotfiles to your programs config files.
My scripts are stored in `~/.config/HyprV/waybar/scripts`, so if you want to store them 
somewhere else, you need to their paths.
